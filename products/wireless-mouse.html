      <em>
        A wireless mouse is a computer pointing device that connects to a
        computer without the use of a physical cable. It typically uses
        Bluetooth or a USB receiver with radio frequency (RF) technology to
        communicate with the computer. Wireless mice offer greater flexibility
        and mobility, making them ideal for reducing desktop clutter and for use
        with laptops.</em
