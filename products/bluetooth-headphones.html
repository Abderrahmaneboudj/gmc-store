          >Bluetooth headphones are wireless audio devices that connect to
          smartphones, computers, or other compatible devices using Bluetooth
          technology. They eliminate the need for physical cables, offering
          greater freedom of movement. Bluetooth headphones are commonly used
          for listening to music, making phone calls, and gaming. Many models
          include features like noise cancellation, built-in microphones, and
          touch controls for convenience and enhanced audio experience.</i
